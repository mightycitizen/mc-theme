# Environments/Deployment Processes

## Repo + Deployment

Buddy.Works is used for code repository and deployment, which uses standard Git workflow/syntax. You will need access to Buddy.works in order to make changes.
### Git workflow
- Run a `git pull` to ensure you have latest code.
- Use a `feature/` or `bugfix/` branch created off of `main`
- Make changes to the new branch you just created
- Push this new branch to the repository to ensure we have code changes saved.
- Merge new branch with dev when ready for review, then deploy to dev environment
- When changes have been reviewed and confirmed that they can be pushed live, merge new branch with `main` and deploy to production (again, if relevant, run any post-deployment processes).

### Deployment
In Buddy.works, the `dev` branch + environment is set to automatically deploy, while `main` branch + `production` environment is set up to manually deploy.
